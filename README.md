Julia Tutorial from MIT IAP 2013
================================

The material here was used in the Julia tutorial at MIT IAP 2013. It contains the following:

1. `LightningRound` is a rapid introduction to Julia, with a number of quick examples designed to give a feel for the language. The presentation and example codes are both included.

2. `Vision` contains a presentation on the overall julia vision.

3. `DataFrames` contains a presentation on using the Julia DataFrames package, with a number of examples and exercises.

4. `Stats` contains a presentation on doing statistics with Julia.

5. `GridOfResistors` is an exercise where the students compute the effective resistance in a grid of resistors, and highlights various performance characteristics and language features.

6. `NumericalOptimization` is an exercise where students explore different types of parallelism in julia in the context of a numerical optimization problem.
